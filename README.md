Intelligent Cold-Chain Monitoring & Failure Prediction System

## Project Overview

EcoCold is an IoT + AI based system designed to monitor temperature, humidity, and motion inside refrigerated environments and predict potential cold-chain failures.

The system combines:
- Embedded sensors (MPU-6050 - mic module -DHT11)
- ESP32
- Machine Learning prediction model (Python)
- Mobile application
- Cloud communication



## Machine Learning Model
